# Bineasy (Reverse)

## Description (problem statement)

I want to run SIMITARRA in my computer but I completely forgot my password, can you help me find it? Here's the program, I think IDA might help.

## Summary (solution)

This is a case of a hard coded password (flag) in the code. It can be exploited by using, for example, a program like IDA and looking for strings.
You'll find the 'password' `SINFCTF2021{n3v3r_h4rdc0de_p4ssw0rds}` and you can log in for a nice surprise :-) .
