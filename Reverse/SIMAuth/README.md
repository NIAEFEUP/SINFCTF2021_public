# SIMAuth (Reverse)

## Description (problem statement)

After the huge failure last time, we decided to test a brand new authentication feature for SIMITARRA. There's no way you can break this one!

## Summary (solution)

The password is validated if the sum of the ASCII characters is both divisible by 109 and 327. The target string is `couveflor` but others may work.
