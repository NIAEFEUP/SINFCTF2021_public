# Calculus? (Forensics)

## Description (problem statement)

What a crazy **series** this competition has been! I'm so happy that I'm giving you the flag for free. But be careful, you might need an n^2 algorithm...

Note: Forget about Big O notation, that doesn't add up.

## Summary (solution)

The flag is hidden in the enormous text given in the file. You can obtain the flag by applying an n^2 series, where each term is the position of one of the flag's letters. For example:

i = 1 -> S (0 + 1^2)

i = 5 -> I (1 + 2^2)

i = 14 -> N (5 + 3^2)

...

The flag is `SINFCTF2021{4nd_h3r3_I_w4s_h1d1ng_1n_th3_bush3s_4ll_4l0ng}`
