# 1964 (Crypto)

## Description (problem statement)

SIMITARRA is a really old website, and it shows! The other day I was searching through some ancient
files, which dated back to SMITARRA creation, but I couldn't figure out what they meant!
Could would help me find out what the SMITARRA creators were trying to say?

## Summary (solution)

As the name of the challange implies, you have to use base64 to dechipher the text.
After a couple of goes (6) at it, you get the flag: SINFCTF2021{its_all_about_the_base_bas3_base_bas3_base}
