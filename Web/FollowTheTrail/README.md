# Follow the trail (Web)

## Description (problem statement)

SIMITARRA can be confusing some times. They make you go to to thousands of pages before you find what you need...

## Summary (solution)

Build a python script to go through the pages and get the next page, the position of the char, and the hexadecimal char. The script must stop when finding the page with "You reached the bottom! Congratulations!!". At this point, ordering the hex chars with the given position for each one will build an image with the flag.
