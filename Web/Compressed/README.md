# Compressed (Web)

## Description (problem statement)

I found this page on SIMITARRA, and it seems a bit strange. They told me that the flag was a little obfuscated. Do you know what that means?

## Summary (solution)

Javascript Packed functions. You just need to unpack the js function in the page head to know how to get the flag.
